# Twitter Data Analysis with Ntscrapper

## Overview
Embark on a journey of Twitter Data Analysis with Ntscrapper. This project allows you to explore, clean, and preprocess tweets to uncover trends, sentiments, and patterns. Decode the language of tweets for valuable insights and informed decision-making.

## Features

- Utilizes Ntscrapper for comprehensive Twitter data analysis.
- Identifies trends, sentiments, and patterns in tweets.
- Cleans and preprocesses tweet data for effective analysis.
- Extracts valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Ntscrapper
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NLTK
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/twitter-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed. If not, install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This will open the Jupyter Notebook dashboard in your web browser. Navigate to the `Data_Analysis.ipynb` file and open it.

2. **Run Code Cells:**
   Execute the code cells in the notebook by selecting each cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`.

3. **Convert Notebook to Python Script (Optional):**
   If you prefer to run the code outside of Jupyter Notebook, convert the notebook to a Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to script Data_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
   This will generate a `.py` file that can be executed with Python. Note that some interactive functionalities may not work outside Jupyter.

4. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Data_Analysis.py
   ```

## Functionality

- **Launch the Application:**
  Start the application to begin analyzing Twitter data.
  
- **Analyze Trends, Sentiments, and Patterns:**
  Explore the data to identify significant trends, sentiments, and patterns in tweets.
  
- **Clean and Preprocess Data:**
  Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the tweets for analysis.
  
- **Extract Insights:**
  Decode the language of tweets to extract actionable insights for decision-making.
